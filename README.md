### Address Example

There are multiple ways to create an Address object.

```php
//Method 1
$address1 = new Address([
    '@ID' => 1,
    'Address2' => '123 Fake St.',
    'City' => 'Springfield',
    'State' => 'CA',
    'Zip4' => 90210
]);

//Method 2
$address2 = new Address();

$address2->setID('1');
$address2->setAddress2('123 Fake St.');
$address2->setCity('Springfield');
$address2->setState('CA');
$address2->setZip4(90210);
```

Both methods can be used, and address objects can be updated or overridden on the fly using the 'set' methods.
 
### AddressValidate Example

```php
use Multidimensional\Usps;

$address = new Address([
    '@ID' => 1,
    'Address2' => '123 Fake St.',
    'City' => 'Springfield',
    'State' => 'CA',
    'Zip4' => 90210
]);
$addressValidate = new AddressValidate();
$addressValidate->addAddress($address);

$response = $addressValidate->validate();

if ($addressValidate->isSuccess()) {

    //do stuff

} else {
    
    $addressValidate->getErrorMessage();

}
```
